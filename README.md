# Rift  
Rift is a portal to connects students and teachers in a class.  
Students and teachers can post messages and replies to messages. Anyone can post notes (as a pdf or .docx) for a given section, and the class can vote on who's notes are the best. Students each get one vote per posted note, while the teacher can vote an unlimited number of times.  
Teachers have a tool to instantly create an account for everyone in the class using a text file with the students' names and emails.
